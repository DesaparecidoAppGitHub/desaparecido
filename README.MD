<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The number of disappearances per day in Spain is worrying, an average of 72 people per day are reported. 202,529 complaints of disappearances have been registered between 2010-2019. ([CNDES](https://cndes-web.ses.mir.es/publico/Desaparecidos/dam/jcr:d46c54af-6529-4eb6-88b6-fb14e38d665b/INFORME%20ANUAL%202022%20ACCESIBLE_corregido.pdf))

Search and Rescue operations have been carried out manually for more than 100 years.
Currently, emergency teams search for the disappeared with the information in physical format and collecting data on blank sheets of paper with a pen. In this context, a shortage of digital tools has been detected to manage this information in a comprehensive, efficient and secure manner. So that the time of action can be reduced to said initial 48 hours and have a better use of resources. The slowness of the administration and the lack of a single database with a standard format makes synchronization of the information difficult, leading to excessive time spent organizing the information for the emergency services.

Desaparecido is a MOBILE and SOCIAL platform that acts in REAL TIME as a UNIVERSAL reliable source of information to help in the search for missing persons OPTIMIZING INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION through gamification and data analysis.
Responsibly providing valuable information in a STANDARD FORMAT that democratizes its ACCESS and EXPLOITATION by a broader community.
